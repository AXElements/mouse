          <h1>mouse</h1>

<p>A port of mouse.rb from <a href="http://github.com/Marketcircle/AXElements">AXElements</a>,
but cleaned up and rewritten in C to be more portable across languages and
runtimes.</p>

<p>By itself, the <code>mouse</code> gem is not that useful; but in combination
with a gem for discovering the positions of things (like buttons) on
the screen, this gem is very powerful and can be used for tasks such
as automated functional
testing; this is the purpose of the
<a href="http://github.com/Marketcircle/AXElements">AXElements</a> project.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre><code>require 'mouse'

Mouse.current_position # =&gt; #&lt;CGPoint x=873.2 y=345.0&gt;

# positions can be given as an array with two points, or a CGPoint
Mouse.move_to [10, 10]
Mouse.move_to CGPoint.new(10, 10)

# optionally specify how long it should take the mouse to move
Mouse.move_to [800, 300], 0.2

Mouse.click
Mouse.double_click
Mouse.triple_click

# secondary_click and right_click are aliases to the same method
Mouse.secondary_click
Mouse.right_click

# positive number scrolls up, negative number scrolls down
Mouse.scroll 10
Mouse.scroll -10

# perform horizontal scrolling as well
# positive number scrolls left, negative number scrolls right
Mouse.horizontal_scroll 10
Mouse.horizontal_scroll -10

# optionally specify units for scroll amount, :pixel or :line
Mouse.scroll 10, :pixels
Mouse.scroll -10, :pixels

# just like a two finger double tap
Mouse.smart_magnify
Mouse.smart_magnify [600, 500]

# pinch-to-zoom
Mouse.pinch :zoom
Mouse.pinch :expand, 2

# pinch-to-unzoom
Mouse.pinch :unzoom, 2.0, 5.0
Mouse.pinch :contract, 1.0

# even perform rotation gestures!
Mouse.rotate :clockwise, 90
Mouse.rotate :counter_clockwise, 180
Mouse.rotate :cw, 360

# swipe, swipe, swipe
Mouse.swipe :up
Mouse.swipe :down
Mouse.swipe :left
Mouse.swipe :right
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="http://rdoc.info/gems/mouse/Mouse">Mouse Documentation</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that when you ask the mouse to move to a specific
location that it may not end up at the exact co-ordinates, but it will
be close (distance of less than 1). This is by design, but that may
change in the future if there are enough complaints.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>[ ] More mouse gesture support</li>
<li>[ ] Make animation duration accurate (current naivet√© has a bit of error)</li>
<li>[ ] Import test app and specialize so we can have better tests</li>
