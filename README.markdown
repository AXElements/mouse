# mouse

A port of mouse.rb from [AXElements](http://github.com/Marketcircle/AXElements),
but cleaned up and rewritten in C to be more portable across languages and
runtimes.

By itself, the `mouse` gem is not that useful; but in combination
with a gem for discovering the positions of things (like buttons) on
the screen, this gem is very powerful and can be used for tasks such
as automated functional
testing; this is the purpose of the
[AXElements](http://github.com/Marketcircle/AXElements) project.

## Examples

    require 'mouse'

    Mouse.current_position # => #<CGPoint x=873.2 y=345.0>

    # positions can be given as a an array with two points, or a CGPoint
    Mouse.move_to [10, 10]
    Mouse.move_to CGPoint.new(10, 10)

    # optionally specify how long it should take the mouse to move
    Mouse.move_to [800, 300], 0.2

    Mouse.click
    Mouse.double_click
    Mouse.triple_click

    # secondary_click and right_click are aliases to the same method
    Mouse.secondary_click
    Mouse.right_click

    # positive number scrolls up, negative number scrolls down
    Mouse.scroll 10
    Mouse.scroll -10

    # perform horizontal scrolling as well
    # positive number scrolls left, negative number scrolls right
    Mouse.horizontal_scroll 10
    Mouse.horizontal_scroll -10

    # optionally specify units for scroll amount, :pixel or :line
    Mouse.scroll 10, :pixels
    Mouse.scroll -10, :pixels

    # just like a two finger double tap
    Mouse.smart_magnify
    Mouse.smart_magnify [600, 500]

    # pinch-to-zoom
    Mouse.pinch :zoom
    Mouse.pinch :expand, 2

    # pinch-to-unzoom
    Mouse.pinch :unzoom, 2.0, 5.0
    Mouse.pinch :contract, 1.0

    # even perform rotation gestures!
    Mouse.rotate :clockwise, 90
    Mouse.rotate :counter_clockwise, 180
    Mouse.rotate :cw, 360

    # swipe, swipe, swipe
    Mouse.swipe :up
    Mouse.swipe :down
    Mouse.swipe :left
    Mouse.swipe :right


See the [Mouse Documentation](http://rdoc.info/gems/mouse/Mouse) for
more details.

You may have noticed that when you ask the mouse to move to a specific
location that it may not end up at the exact co-ordinates, but it will
be close (distance of less than 1). This is by design, but that may
change in the future if there are enough complaints.


## TODO

- [ ] More mouse gesture support
- [ ] Make animation duration accurate (current naivet√© has a bit of error)
- [ ] Import test app and specialize so we can have better tests
